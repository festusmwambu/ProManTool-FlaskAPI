# Pro-Man-Tool

`ProManTool` is an open-source project management software that is specifically developed to support the `kanban methodology`, which is a way of organizing and managing projects to improve efficiency and effectiveness.
It is build using `Python-Flask` for backend/server, `React-Typescript` for frontend/client, `Sass`as the CSS preprocessor, `Redux` for centralized state management, and `PostgreSQL` as a relational database. The tests for backend are done on `pytest` and the tests for the frontend are done on `jest`.
The project also incorporates `GitHub OAuth` for authentication and authorization, `Google Analytics 4` which collects event-based and page view data from websites, web applications and mobile applications, and `Google reCAPTCHA v2` to protect sites from fraudulent activities, spam, and abuse.
